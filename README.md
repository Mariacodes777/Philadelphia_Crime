Exploration into Public Data of Crime in Philadelphia

I had this idea to try to explore the crime data in the city as we had a meeting one day at work reviewing our area. Crime is not normally something I would want to focus on. It is good to be aware of the issues in the city in order to be able to address them and highlight areas that may have gone unnoticed otherwise. Displaying the data effectively to offer insights in facilitating ideas for potential solutions is key. I hope you enjoy!
